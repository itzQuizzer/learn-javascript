to link javascript to hmtl we have 2 method either write <script> inside body tag or head tag 

or you can link it using link tag <script src="hello.js"></script>

hello.js :

document.writeln("hello iam dinesh");

in this code either you can use the semicolon ; or not doesnot matter.
and similarly inside box you can use double " or ' but it works
